# AWS Networking Models - Unit Tests

This directory contains comprehensive unit tests for AWS networking models and constraints. The tests verify the logic and validation rules for VPCs, subnets, route tables, gateways, and their relationships.

## Overview

The test suite validates:
- **VPC Region Constraints**: Ensures VPCs are confined to a single region
- **Subnet CIDR Validation**: Checks for CIDR overlaps and validates subnet CIDRs are within VPC CIDR ranges
- **Subnet AZ Constraints**: Verifies subnets are assigned to a single Availability Zone
- **Internet Gateway**: Validates IGW configuration and VPC attachments
- **NAT Gateway**: Validates NAT gateway configuration and subnet relationships
- **Route Tables**: Tests route table validation and route target configurations
- **Route Table Associations**: Validates route table associations with subnets

## Test Structure

All tests follow a **table-driven design** pattern, making them easy to extend and maintain. Each test file:
- Defines test cases in a structured format
- Provides detailed console output showing test execution
- Validates both positive and negative scenarios
- Includes descriptive test names and error messages

## Test Data

The tests use the following consistent test data:

- **Region**: `us-east-1`
- **Availability Zones**: `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`
- **VPC CIDR**: `10.0.0.0/16`
- **Public Subnet**: `10.0.1.0/24` (us-east-1a) - Contains NAT gateway
- **Private Subnet 1**: `10.0.2.0/24` (us-east-1a)
- **Private Subnet 2**: `10.0.3.0/24` (us-east-1b)
- **Private Subnet 3**: `10.0.4.0/24` (us-east-1a)

## Dependencies

The tests depend on:
- `cloudcanvas-backend/internal/aws/models/networking` - AWS networking models
- `cloudcanvas-backend/internal/aws/configs` - AWS configuration types
- `net` package (standard library) - For CIDR parsing and validation

## Helper Functions

The tests utilize helper functions from the parent package:
- `networking.CIDROverlaps()` - Checks if two CIDR blocks overlap
- `networking.CIDRContains()` - Checks if parent CIDR contains child CIDR
- `Subnet.ValidateCIDRInVPC()` - Validates subnet CIDR is within VPC CIDR
- `Subnet.GetCIDRBlock()` - Parses and returns CIDR block

## Adding New Tests

To add a new test case:

1. Add a new entry to the test cases slice in the appropriate test file
2. Follow the existing table-driven test structure
3. Include a descriptive name and description
4. Set expected error (if any)
5. Add console output for test execution visibility

Example:
```go
{
    name: "new-test-case-name",
    resource: &networking.Resource{
        // ... resource configuration
    },
    expectedError: nil, // or error if expected
    description: "Description of what this test validates",
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Table-Driven Design**: All tests use table-driven approach for consistency
2. **Descriptive Names**: Test names clearly describe what is being tested
3. **Console Output**: Tests print detailed execution information
4. **Error Validation**: Both positive and negative test cases are included
5. **Relationship Validation**: Tests verify relationships between resources (VPC-subnet, route table-subnet, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing
- Check that all required fields are set in test data
- Verify CIDR formats are correct (e.g., "10.0.0.0/16")
- Ensure VPC IDs match between related resources
- Check that Availability Zones follow the region-az pattern (e.g., "us-east-1a")

### CIDR Validation Issues
- Ensure subnet CIDR is more specific (larger mask number) than VPC CIDR
- Verify subnet CIDR is within VPC CIDR range
- Check for CIDR overlaps between subnets

### Route Table Issues
- Ensure route has exactly one target (IGW, NAT Gateway, etc.)
- Verify route table and subnets are in the same VPC
- Check that destination CIDR is valid
